# Memory Managment: Less Frustration, Models, Ownership, and More!

---

# Stack vs. Heap: Scope

---

# Scope 

## Python Example: 

```python
def MyFunction(): 
	a = 10 # 'a' is created ON THE STACK in this indent block's 
		   # scope when 'MyFunction' is run



# 'a' was created in the scope of 'MyFunction', 
# it can not be referenced outside
# of 'MyFunction''s indent block
# ...
a += 1 # Error 'a' referenced before assignment
```

- We will be using langauges with C-like syntax for the rest of this presentaiton

---

# Scope

## Equivlent Java Example (C-like Syntax): 

```java
void MyFunction()
{

	int a = 10; // 'a' is created ON THE STACK in 'MyFunction''s 
			    // scope (in between the brackets)


} // 'a' is destroyed at the end of scope




// ... later

a += 10; // Error: What is 'a'?

```

---

# Scope: Excecizes[0]

- Lets play: Does it compile?!

```java
void MyFunction()
{
	int a = 10;
	if(a > 5)
	{
		System.out.println(a);
	}
	a += 8;
}
```

---

# Scope: Excecizes[0]

- Lets play: Does it compile?!

```java
void MyFunction()
{

	int a = 10; // Begin 'a's scope
	
	if(a > 5)
	{
	
		System.out.println(a); // Fine, inside 'a's scope
		
	}
	
	a += 8; // Fine, inside of 'a's scope
	
} // End 'a's scope, 'a' destroyed here
```

		int b = 42; // Begin 'b's scope
		
		System.out.println(a + b); // Fine, inside 'a's and 'b's scope
		
	} // End 'b's scope, 'b' destroyed here
	
	a += 8; // Fine, inside 'a's scope
	
} // End 'a's scope, 'a' destroyed here
```

# One More Thing About Scope (For Now)

## Function parameters have scope!

```java
void MyFunction(int myParameter)
{ // Begining of 'myParameter's scope


	int myInt = 42; // Begining of 'myInt's scope

	System.out.println(myInt + myParameter);

# Getting into the weeds: Pass-By-Reference vs. Pass-By-Value
## An important distinction!

---
# Lets start with Pass-By-Value

---
# Pass By Value: 

Suppose I have a function like this: 
```java
void MyFunction(int myParameter)
{
	myParameter += 1;
}
```

Later I write: 

```java
int myValue = 20;
MyFunction(myValue);
System.out.println(myValue);
```

- Supposing this code compiles, what is the output?

---
# Pass By Value:

MyFunction(myValue);
System.out.println(myValue);
```

- Supposing this code compiles, what is the _**output**_?
- **Answer:** _`20`_

---
# Pass By Value:

void MyFunction(int myParameter)
{
	myParameter += 1;
}
```

```

- **Answer:** _`20`_
- Did you say: _WAT?!_

---
# The value does not change?
```java
int myValue = 20;
MyFunction(myValue);
System.out.println(myValue); // 20
```
---
# Why is that?

---
# Pass By Value: 

```java
void MyFunction(int myParameter)
{
	myParameter += 1;
} // Recall, myParameter is destroyed here
```

Later I write: 

```java
int myValue = 20;
MyFunction(myValue);
System.out.println(myValue); // Is 'myValue' 'myParameter'?
```

---
# Pass By Value: 

Lets rewrite the code
```java
static int myParameter; // Global variable
void MyFunction()
{
	myParameter += 1;
}
```

Later you write: 

```java
int myValue = 20;

myParameter = myValue; // Not present before
MyFunction(); // Replacing MyFunction(myValue);

System.out.println(myValue);
```

- Supposing the example compiles, _**now**_ what do you think the _**output**_ is?

---
# Pass By Value:

}
```

int myValue = 20;

myParameter = myValue; // Not present before

```

- Supposing the example compiles, _**now**_ what do you think the _**output**_ is?
- Answer: _`20`_ again


---
# Pass By Value: 

This: 
```java
void AddOneParameter(int myParameter)
{
	myParameter += 1;
}
```
Is basically equal to this: 
```java
static int myParameter; // Global variable
void AddOneGlobal()
{
	myParameter += 1;
}
```

***_If_*** You change the value of _`myParameter`_ each time before you call _`AddOneGlobal`_
---
# Pass By Value
...basically equal to this: 
```java
static int myParameter; // Global variable
void AddOneGlobal()
{
	myParameter += 1;
}
```
***_If_*** You change the value of _`myParameter`_ each time before you call _`AddOneGlobal`_


i.e
```java
int myValue = 41;
myParameter = myValue;
AddOneGlobal();
System.out.println(myParameter); // Prints 42
myParameter = 19;
AddOneGlobal();
System.out.println(myParameter); // Prints 20
```
---
# Pass By Value: 

This: 
```java
void AddOneParameter(int myParameter)
{
	myParameter += 1;
}
```
Is basically equal to this: 
```java
static int myParameter; // Global variable
void AddOneGlobal()
{
	myParameter += 1;
}
```
Notice either way you call either version of _AddOne_ _myValue_ never changes!
---
# Pass By Value: 
Notice either way you call either version of _AddOne_ _myValue_ never changes!
```java
void AddOneParameter(int myParameter)
{
	myParameter += 1;
}
//...
int myValue = 41;
AddOneParameter(myValue);
System.out.println(myValue); // Prints 41
```
```java
static int myParameter; // Global variable
void AddOneGlobal()
{
	myParameter += 1;
}
//...
int myValue = 41;
myParameter = myValue;
AddOneGlobal();
System.out.println(myValue); // Prints 41
```
--
- **_Why_**?

---
# Pass By Value
- Pass By Value means that values are _copied_, _duplicated_.
--

- More than one bit of variable/memory storing the value exists at once!
--

```java
void AddOneParameter(int myParameter)
{
		myParameter += 1;
}
//...
int myValue = 41;
AddOneParameter(myValue); // The VALUE of 'myValue' is copied into a 
							  // temporary variable, 'myParameter'
System.out.println(myValue); // Prints 41, 'myParameter' is gone, it 
								 // was a COPY of myValue, not a reference too 
								 // it, any changes made to 'myParameter' ONLY 
								 // apply to 'myParameter'
```

|line||myValue||myParameter|
|-----------------||-------||-----------------|
|int myValue = 41;||41||*does not exist*|
|AddOneParameter(myValue);||41||41|
|myParameter += 1;||41||42|

# Pass By Value
## myValue vs. myParameter, two independant variables!

# Pass By Value: Test Your Knowlege!
```java
void PythagoreanTheorem(int x, int y)
{
	x *= x;
	y *= y;
	int hypotenuse = x + y;
	System.out.println(hypotenuse);
}

//later ...

int x = 10;
int y = 5;

PythagoreanTheorem(x, y);
System.out.println(x);
System.out.println(y);
```

- What is the _*output*_ of this program (hint: there are 3)?
--

- Answer: 125, 10, 5 (On seperate lines)
--

- Remeber _`x`_ outside _`PythagoreanTheorem`_ is not the same _`x`_ inside _`PythagoreanTheorem`_

---
# Pass By Value: Test Your Knowlege!
```java

void PythagoreanTheorem(int x, int y) {
	// ...
}

//later ...

int x = 10;
int y = 5;

PythagoreanTheorem(x, y);
System.out.println(x);
System.out.println(y);
```
- Remeber _`x`_ outside _`PythagoreanTheorem`_ is not the same _`x`_ inside _`PythagoreanTheorem`_. 
--

- Why? 
--

- Reason 0: At the time _`PythagoreanTheorem`_ is defined, there is no `x` except for the parameter `x`, `PythagoreanTheorem` is not modified retroactivley to include the later variable `x`
--

- Reason 1: Suppose the later `x` were declared inside another set of brackets at the same level as those from `PythagoreanTheorem`, what would it mean to have both scopes existing in parallel?
---
# Pass By Value 
## The real reason: Modularity and Abstraction
```java
void PythagoreanTheorem(int x, int y) {
	// ...
}
```
--

- When passing by value, the programmer only needs to worry about the variables in scope, they dont have to worry about affecting the rest of the program
--

- They also do not have to worry about unitnentonally or improperly changing anything else, the rest of the program can continue as if the passed values are the same
--

- Programmers also do not have to worry about changing the value of variables unexpectantly on other programmers
--

## Problem
--
- How do I get data out of functions?

---
# Pass By Value

This function is great if all I want to do is print a hypotenuse

```java
void PythagoreanTheorem(int x, int y)
{
	x *= x;
	y *= y;
	int hypotenuse = x + y;
	System.out.println(hypotenuse);
}
```
--

But what if I actually want to _use_ the value the hypotenuse

```java
PythagoreanTheorem(10, 5);
int vectorMagnitude = Math.sqrt( //... what do I put here ?!?!?!
```
---
# Pass By Value

```java
void PythagoreanTheorem(int x, int y)
{
	x *= x;
	y *= y;
	int hypotenuse = x + y;
	System.out.println(hypotenuse);
}
```

Lets re-write the function

--

```java
int PythagoreanTheorem(int x, int y)
{
	x *= x;
	y *= y;
	int hypotenuse = x + y;
	return hypotenuse;
}
```

- Notice instead of `void` we have `int` indicating the type of data that will be returned from the function
- Notice the `return` keyword, this copies the value of what is next too it and puts it into a sort of "invisible temporary"
---
# Pass By Value
```java
int PythagoreanTheorem(int x, int y)
{
	x *= x;
	y *= y;
	int hypotenuse = x + y;
	return hypotenuse;
}
```
Sweet! Now I can use it: 

```java
// myHypotenuse is a copy of the "invisible temporary" "returned"
// by 'PythagoreanTheorem' which copied the value of 'hypotenuse'
int myHypotenuse = PythagoreanTheorem(10, 5); 
int vectorMagnitude = Math.sqrt(myHypotenuse); // Ah', much better!
```
--
```java
// 'myHypotenuse' was a copy of a value, so we know for sure, 
// that it is not affected by this later call to PythagoreanTheorem
int myOtherHypotenuse = PythagoreanTheorem(42, 21); 
```
---
# Pass By Value

You can discard a return value, but, for a well-written function, this implies that some part of the function is not actually being used
```java
PythagoreanTheorem(10, 5); // So long and thanks for all the fish! 

// (no effect on the rest of the program, except warming up the cpu a bit)
```
---
# Pass By Value

Reinforcing the concept: lets re-write this: 
```java
int PythagoreanTheorem(int x, int y)
{
	x *= x;
	y *= y;
	int hypotenuse = x + y;
	return hypotenuse;
}
```
--
```java
static int uglyGlobalHypotenuse;
void PythagoreanTheoremGlobal(int x, int y)
{
	x *= x;
	y *= y;
	uglyGlobalHypotenuse = x + y;
}
```
- Notice the second function is `void`
---
# Pass By Value 
```java
static int uglyGlobalHypotenuse;
void PythagoreanTheoremGlobal(int x, int y)
{
	x *= x;
	y *= y;
	uglyGlobalHypotenuse = x + y;
}
```
Lets use the re-written function
```java
PythagoreanTheoremGlobal(10, 5);
int myHypotenuse0 = uglyGlobalHypotenuse;
// ^^ Basically the same as: 
int myHypotenuse1 = PythagoreanTheorem(10, 5); 
```
- Issue: If you are writing hundreds of functions, you need to keep track of the name of each global return value, it would become quite copius
- Issue: Also someone could change with a return value when you expect it to be the return value of a function
- Issue: The return value variable is not nessisiarly tied with a call to its companion function
--

- Dont do this


---

# Pass By Value: Excecizes
```java
int Square(int x)
{
	x *= x;
	return x;
}
int Hypotenuse(int x, int y) {
	return Square(x) + Square(y);
}
// float is a decimal number type
float Magnitude(int x, int y) {
	return Math.sqrt(Hypotenuse(x, y));
}
//later... 
int x = 4;
int y = 3;
int myMagnitude = Magnitude(x, y);
System.out.println(x);
System.out.println(y);
System.out.println(myMagnitude);
```
- What is the _**output**_ of this program (all 3) assuming it compiles?
--
 **_Answers:_** 4, 3, 5 (on seperate lines without commas)

If you want to pose questions in the form of code, send me a share link too your code on godbolt.org

# Congradulations
## By learning about pass-by-value you also just learned about a key concept: the Stack!
--

- The stack technichally is like a stack data structure, when arguments are passed to a function, copies of the values to be passed too te function are put on top of the stack, when new values are created, they are also put on top of the stack, when they reach end of scope, they are removed, usually in reverse order (LIFO: Last In First Out)

--

```java
void MyFunction(int a, int b) {
	int c = a * b + (a - b);
}
// ...
int a = 1;
int b = 2;
MyFunction(a, b);
```
--

- Real quick: What are the values of `a`, and `b` at the end?

--

- Answer: 1 and 2 respectivley

# Lets Get a Bit More Technichal: Allocate
## Allocate: 
- For our purposes, allocate can be thought of "creating" or reserving memory.
- For example: If I have 1 Gigibyte of memory, I may set aside (reserve) 4 bytes (32 bits) for an integer when I type: `int myInt = 42;`
- Memory is not actually "created" or "destroyed", but from the perspective of the programmer, often it can be thought of this way.

# We Could Stop Here: 
- Ignoring performence constraints, technichally, we dont _need_ anything other than pass-by-value
- An entire paradigm/class of programming languages exist that use only Read-Only Pass-By-Value Stack Only _Memory Model_, these are called _Functional_ programming langauges
- Examples: Elixir, Haskell, Common LISP, Closure, OCamel
- In many languages can be used as functional languages, including C, C++, Java (kinda)
- Functinal Languages dont typically use loops, because loops require some value to change in-place to control the loop, functional languages tend too use **_read-only_**, immutable values, so recursion is used instead
- Here I will introduce the `const` keyword from C, it means a value can only be read, but not written too (past when it is initialized)

- But there are motivations to Pass By Reference

---
# Why Pass By Reference: 

## Performence
- Suppose I have an array of 1 million values, and I need to pass it to 3 different functions, if I am using pass-by-value, it must copy the entire array each time (without compiler optimizations), then I also must copy the array to return the array each time.
- If this application needs to perform in any reasonable amount of time this is a bad idea, especially for an application like a game, which may need to run at at least 60 Frames Per Second, that would be 180 * 1 million operations at least each second just for this.
## Foreshadowing
- Later we will see that we also often need Pass By Reference for dynaimically sized data (arrays with the lengths we want)

- In Java, any built-in type that starts with a lower case letter, except arrays, will pass by value: 

	- This means basic types, like `int`, `float` (decimal number), `double` (better decimal number), `boolean` (true or false), and `char` (single character, but NOT a string)

	- These are often called _Primitive Types_
--



- In Java, any built-in or standard library (class type) type that starts with an upper case letter, as well as arrays is a _Pass By Value_ type: 

--

	- One of the most familiar of these types are `String`'s (including string literals e.g `"ABCDEFG"`) 

--

	- Another familiar _Reference Type_ type is any array, even an array of a _Primitive Type_ like `int` (e.g `new int[10]` or `int[]`)

--

	- Other examples may be `Scanner, Integer, ArrayList, Exception, File, BufferedReader`, and any `class` you define

---
## Pass By Reference: An Example: 
```java
void MyFunction(int[] myIntegers) {
	myIntegers[myIntegers.length / 2] = 42;
}
//Later ...
int[] data = new int[10]; // Note the 'new' keyword... we'll come back too that ;)
for(int ii = 0; ii < data.length; ++ii) {
	data[ii] = ii; // The loop creates a list of integers 0 - 9
}
MyFunction(data);
for(int ii = 0; ii < data.length; ++ii) {
	System.out.println(data[ii]);
}
```
- What is the _**output**_ of this program?
--

- Answer: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 42, 6, 7, 8, 9
--

- Why?
--
: Remember, Java array's, even of primitive types, are _class types_, and are thus Pass By Reference
--

- This actually not exactly true... you only directly interact with class types when creating them in Java...
--

- Any variable declared with a class type is actually a _reference_. The data for the class itself is _allocated_ with the `new` keyword.
--

- In order to use the data created with `new` we take advantage of the fact that it **_must_** exist somewhere in memory, and that location has a _Memory Address_

---

```java
void MyFunction(int[] myIntegers) {
	myIntegers[myIntegers.length / 2] = 42;
}
//Later ...
int[] data = new int[10]; // Note the 'new' keyword... we'll come back too that ;)
for(int ii = 0; ii < data.length; ++ii) {
	data[ii] = ii; // The loop creates a list of integers 0 - 9
}
MyFunction(data);
for(int ii = 0; ii < data.length; ++ii) {
	System.out.println(data[ii]);
}
```
- Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 42, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Any variable declared with a class type is actually a _reference_. The data for the class itself is _allocated_ with the `new` keyword.
- In order to use the data created with `new` we take advantage of the fact that it **_must_** exist somewhere in memory, and that location has a _Memory Address_
- Java then allows us to use the `.` operator (or in the special case of arrays `[]`) on the reference, then "relays" the instruction to the data in memory

# We are getting a bit ahead of ourselves...
--

## Lets take a step back

---
# Taking a Step Back
- In Java, the concept of reference types is nessiarily connected to dynamic memory allocation, the heap, class types, garbage collection, etc.
--

- Its a bit confusing as well, because there is not much **_explicit_** syntax to differentiate reference types from value types
--

- This is not the case in C, therefore, we will continue in C to teach these concepts (though much of the code is similar to Java).

# Pointer's In C

- Imagine the memory in your computer like a grid.
	- Each box in the grid has a number and contains 1 byte

![alt text](Diagrams/Memory0.drawio.svg)

--
- Pointers are integers that refer to one of these boxes (technichality... in most implementations)

---
# Example: C Pointer
```c
int myInteger = 10;
int* myPointer = &myInteger;
```

- `int*` means a pointer to `int`, the pointer itself is a number, but that number is the address of a byte in memory. The compiler does not nesssiarily know *what* a pointer contains unless you tell it. `int` is just information *for the compiler*
- `&` can be read as "address of"
- `int* myPointer = &myInteger;` can be read as "Create a pointer to an integer, called myPointer, and assign it to the address of myInteger (an `int`)"

---
# Example: C Pointer
But what do I do with a pointer?
```c
int myInteger = 10;
int* myPointer = &myInteger;
// myPointer += 10 adds 10 to the pointer, or rather, 
// the address myPointer is pointing too, doing nothing to myInteger
// Can I do anything to myInteger using the myPointer?
```
We need the "de-reference" operator `*`

```c
*myPointer += 10;
```
`*` tells the program, "go too the address contained by myPointer, and then do whatever is on the right too it (in this case += 10)"


---
# Pointer Question

```c
int x = 10;
int* p = &x;
*p += 32;
```

What is the value of `x`?

--

- Answer: _**42**_! (The Meaning of Life The Universe and Everything!)

--

- Yes this example, I know, may be a bit trivial

---
# Another Pointer Question

```c
int xbox = 50;
int* playStation = &xbox;
int gameCube = *playStation;
gameCube += 50;
```

What is the value of `xbox`?

--

- Answer: _50_

--
, `playStation` referes to `xbox`, but `gameCube` copies the value pointed-to/de-referenced by `playStation`, so it copies the value  of `xbox`, then adds 50 too itself, so `gameCube` is 100, while `xbox` remains unchanged (50).

---
# Lets go back too the Java example for a second

---

```java
void MyFunction(int[] myIntegers) {
	myIntegers[myIntegers.length / 2] = 42;
}
//Later ...
int[] data = new int[10]; // Note the 'new' keyword... we'll come back too that ;)
for(int ii = 0; ii < data.length; ++ii) {
	data[ii] = ii; // The loop creates a list of integers 0 - 9
}
MyFunction(data);
for(int ii = 0; ii < data.length; ++ii) {
	System.out.println(data[ii]);
}
```
- Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 42, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Java then allows us to use the `.` operator (or in the special case of arrays `[]`) on the reference, then "relays" the instruction to the data in memory
--




- ^^ This is kindof like Java's version of de-referencing, it allows us to interact with the value pointed-to/referred-to by the reference (in this case myIntegers and data, which refer to the same value).

---
# Interacting With Data
Interacting with pointed-to data in C (_Explicit_)
```c
*myPointer += 5; // Write
printf("%i", *myPointer) // Read
// ^^ NOTE: "%i" means substitute %i with an integer
```
Interacting with pointed-to data in Java (_Implicit_)
```java
myIntegers[5] = 42 // Write
myIntegers.length // Read
```

---

```java
void MyFunction(int[] myIntegers) {
	myIntegers[myIntegers.length / 2] = 42;
}
//Later ...
int[] data = new int[10]; // Note the 'new' keyword... we'll come back too that ;)
for(int ii = 0; ii < data.length; ++ii) {
	data[ii] = ii; // The loop creates a list of integers 0 - 9
}
MyFunction(data);
for(int ii = 0; ii < data.length; ++ii) {
	System.out.println(data[ii]);
}
```
- Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 42, 6, 7, 8, 9
- The reason for the answer to our earilier question is because `myInteger` is a reference, and refers to the same data in memory as `data`, so when `myIntegers` changes the data it points to, the values `data` reads are the same as whatever were set through `myIntegers`

 We can do something similar in C

```c
void ChangeData(int* someNumber) {
	*someNumber = 42;
}

int myData[10];
for(int ii = 0; ii < 10; ++ii) {
	myData[ii] = ii; // Create an array 0 - 9
}
int* fifthElement = &myData[5];
ChangeData(&myData[5]);
printf("%i\n", *fifthElement);
```
- Output: 42 (Like before)

</div>

# Remeber that pointers are numbers?
Lets change the example
```c
void ChangeData(int* arrayStart, int arrayLength) {
	arrayStart += sizeof(int) * arrayLength;
	*arrayStart = 900;
}

int myData[10];
for(int ii = 0; ii < 10; ++ii) {
	myData[ii] = ii; // Create an array 0 - 9
}
int* myArray = &myData[0];
ChangeData(myArray, 10);
printf("%i\n", myArray[5]);
```
--

- Output: 42 (Like before)

--

- Remeber pointers are an integer, and they have a type
- Recall each memory address referres to a **_byte_** in memory, and data like _integers_ (`int`) take up **multiple** bytes
--

- Since we have the type of the data we are pointing to (and thus can get its size in bytes), if we know there are integers stored _contigiously_ then we can refer too them `
- Just like in Java, we can use `[]` on pointers, this will derefernence a memory address
